# Mobile Experience Specification

## Overview

This specification defines the mobile experience system for the PetroManager frontend application. The system provides Progressive Web App capabilities, touch-optimized interactions, mobile navigation, and responsive design for optimal mobile user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Progressive Web App

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the app to work like a native app, so that I can access it quickly and work offline when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the app on mobile THEN the system SHALL prompt to install as PWA
2. WHEN installed as PWA THEN the system SHALL work offline with cached data
3. IF the user is offline THEN the system SHALL show cached content and offline indicators
4. WHEN the user comes back online THEN the system SHALL sync data automatically
5. IF PWA features are available THEN the system SHALL provide app-like experience

### Requirement 2: Touch Gestures

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to use touch gestures naturally, so that I can navigate and interact efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user swipes on lists THEN the system SHALL support swipe actions
2. WHEN a user pinches on charts THEN the system SHALL zoom in/out appropriately
3. IF a user long-presses THEN the system SHALL show context menus
4. WHEN a user drags elements THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback
5. IF touch gestures conflict THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most common gesture

### Requirement 3: Mobile Navigation

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want easy navigation that works well on small screens, so that I can access all features quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN on mobile THEN the system SHALL show a bottom navigation bar
2. WHEN navigating THEN the system SHALL use smooth transitions
3. IF the navigation is complex THEN the system SHALL use collapsible menus
4. WHEN a user taps navigation THEN the system SHALL provide haptic feedback
5. IF navigation is deep THEN the system SHALL show breadcrumbs

### Requirement 4: Responsive Tables

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to view table data effectively, so that I can access all information without horizontal scrolling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tables are too wide THEN the system SHALL convert them to card views
2. WHEN showing table data THEN the system SHALL prioritize important columns
3. IF horizontal scroll is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear indicators
4. WHEN a user taps a row THEN the system SHALL show detailed view
5. IF tables are complex THEN the system SHALL provide mobile-optimized layouts

### Requirement 5: Mobile Forms

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want forms that are easy to fill out on touch devices, so that I can enter data efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user focuses on input fields THEN the system SHALL show appropriate keyboards
2. WHEN filling forms THEN the system SHALL provide large touch targets
3. IF forms are long THEN the system SHALL break them into steps
4. WHEN validating forms THEN the system SHALL show errors clearly
5. IF form submission fails THEN the system SHALL preserve user input

### Requirement 6: App-like Experience

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the app to feel native and responsive, so that I can work efficiently on mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL show a splash screen
2. WHEN navigating THEN the system SHALL use native-like animations
3. IF the app is backgrounded THEN the system SHALL maintain state
4. WHEN the app is foregrounded THEN the system SHALL refresh data
5. IF the app crashes THEN the system SHALL recover gracefully
