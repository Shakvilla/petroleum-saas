# Advanced Data Visualization Specification

## Overview

This specification defines the advanced data visualization system for the PetroManager frontend application. The system provides interactive charts, custom dashboards, data export capabilities, and real-time visualization for petroleum distribution analytics.

## Requirements

1. WHEN a user hovers over chart elements THEN the system SHALL show detailed tooltips
2. WHEN a user clicks on chart elements THEN the system SHALL allow drilling down to detailed views
3. IF a chart supports zooming THEN the system SHALL provide zoom controls and mouse wheel support
4. WHEN a user pans a chart THEN the system SHALL smoothly navigate through data
5. IF a chart has multiple data series THEN the system SHALL allow toggling series visibility

### Requirement 2: Custom Dashboards

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create custom dashboards by dragging and dropping widgets, so that I can organize information according to my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters dashboard edit mode THEN the system SHALL show draggable widgets
2. WHEN a user drags a widget THEN the system SHALL show drop zones and preview
3. IF a user drops a widget THEN the system SHALL resize and position it appropriately
4. WHEN a user saves a dashboard THEN the system SHALL persist the layout and configuration
5. IF a user shares a dashboard THEN the system SHALL allow other users to view it

### Requirement 3: Data Export

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export charts and data in various formats, so that I can use the information in reports and presentations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests data export THEN the system SHALL provide PDF, Excel, and CSV options
2. WHEN exporting to PDF THEN the system SHALL maintain chart quality and formatting
3. IF exporting to Excel THEN the system SHALL include both charts and raw data
4. WHEN exporting to CSV THEN the system SHALL include all visible data with proper formatting
5. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL provide error details and retry options

### Requirement 4: Print Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to print charts and dashboards, so that I can create physical copies for meetings and documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user prints a chart THEN the system SHALL optimize the layout for paper
2. WHEN printing dashboards THEN the system SHALL arrange widgets for optimal page usage
3. IF printing large datasets THEN the system SHALL paginate appropriately
4. WHEN printing THEN the system SHALL include headers, footers, and metadata
5. IF print preview is available THEN the system SHALL show how the output will look

### Requirement 5: Chart Annotations

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add annotations to charts, so that I can mark important events and add context to the data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds an annotation THEN the system SHALL allow text, shapes, and arrows
2. WHEN annotating charts THEN the system SHALL position annotations relative to data points
3. IF annotations are added THEN the system SHALL allow editing and deletion
4. WHEN sharing annotated charts THEN the system SHALL include all annotations
5. IF annotations conflict THEN the system SHALL provide collision detection and resolution

### Requirement 6: Real-time Charts

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see charts update in real-time, so that I can monitor live data and trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN real-time data arrives THEN the system SHALL update charts smoothly
2. WHEN updating charts THEN the system SHALL maintain user's current view and zoom level
3. IF real-time updates are frequent THEN the system SHALL batch updates for performance
4. WHEN real-time mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL indicate live status clearly
5. IF real-time connection is lost THEN the system SHALL fall back to polling mode
