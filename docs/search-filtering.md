# Search & Filtering Specification

## Overview

This specification defines the search and filtering system for the PetroManager frontend application. The system provides comprehensive search capabilities, advanced filtering, search suggestions, and search analytics for efficient data discovery across the petroleum distribution platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Global Search

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search across all data in the system, so that I can quickly find any information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a search query THEN the system SHALL search across all relevant data types
2. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL rank them by relevance
3. IF search results are found THEN the system SHALL display them with context and highlights
4. WHEN no results are found THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative search terms
5. IF search takes longer than 2 seconds THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators

### Requirement 2: Advanced Filters

**User Story:** As a user, I want to apply multiple filters to narrow down results, so that I can find exactly what I'm looking for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL combine them with AND logic
2. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL show the active filter count
3. IF a user removes a filter THEN the system SHALL update results immediately
4. WHEN applying multiple filters THEN the system SHALL show how many results match
5. IF filters conflict THEN the system SHALL indicate the conflict and suggest resolution

### Requirement 3: Search Suggestions

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see search suggestions as I type, so that I can find what I'm looking for faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the search box THEN the system SHALL show autocomplete suggestions
2. WHEN suggestions are shown THEN the system SHALL highlight matching text
3. IF a user selects a suggestion THEN the system SHALL execute the search immediately
4. WHEN showing suggestions THEN the system SHALL prioritize popular and recent searches
5. IF suggestions are not relevant THEN the user SHALL be able to dismiss them

### Requirement 4: Search History

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my recent searches, so that I can quickly repeat previous searches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs a search THEN the system SHALL save it to their search history
2. WHEN a user views search history THEN the system SHALL show recent searches with timestamps
3. IF a user clicks on a history item THEN the system SHALL execute that search
4. WHEN managing history THEN the system SHALL allow clearing individual items or all history
5. IF search history is full THEN the system SHALL remove oldest entries automatically

### Requirement 5: Filter Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my filters to persist across page navigation, so that I don't lose my search context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL save them to the URL
2. WHEN a user navigates away THEN the system SHALL preserve filter state
3. IF a user returns to a page THEN the system SHALL restore previous filters
4. WHEN sharing URLs THEN the system SHALL include filter parameters
5. IF filters are invalid THEN the system SHALL reset to default state

### Requirement 6: Search Analytics

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to understand how users search, so that I can improve the search experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users perform searches THEN the system SHALL log search terms and results
2. WHEN analyzing search data THEN the system SHALL identify popular and failed searches
3. IF search results are frequently clicked THEN the system SHALL boost their ranking
4. WHEN search fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure for improvement
5. IF search patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest search optimizations
