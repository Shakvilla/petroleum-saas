# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines comprehensive frontend enhancements for the PetroManager petroleum distribution SaaS platform. The goal is to transform the existing Next.js 15/React 19 application into a performant, scalable, reliable, maintainable, and secure user interface that follows industry best practices for modern frontend development.

The current codebase has a solid foundation with 30+ components, multi-tenant architecture, and responsive design, but requires significant improvements in state management, error handling, performance optimization, accessibility, and security to meet enterprise-grade standards.

## Requirements

6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them for debugging while protecting user privacy
7. IF recovery is possible THEN the system SHALL provide one-click retry mechanisms

### Requirement 4: Security Implementation

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the application to protect my data and prevent security vulnerabilities, so that I can trust the platform with sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user input is received THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all data
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication headers
3. IF sensitive data is stored locally THEN the system SHALL encrypt it before storage
4. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL implement Content Security Policy headers
5. IF XSS attacks are attempted THEN the system SHALL prevent script injection
6. WHEN user sessions expire THEN the system SHALL handle re-authentication gracefully
7. IF security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL log and report them

### Requirement 5: Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want the application to be fully accessible, so that I can use all features regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA compliance standards
2. WHEN users navigate with keyboards THEN the system SHALL provide proper focus management
3. IF screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions
4. WHEN color is used to convey information THEN the system SHALL provide alternative indicators
5. IF text is too small THEN the system SHALL allow users to scale fonts up to 200%
6. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation feedback
7. IF animations are present THEN the system SHALL respect user's motion preferences

### Requirement 6: Code Quality & Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, well-documented, and testable code, so that I can maintain and extend the application efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL follow TypeScript best practices with strict type checking
2. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL implement proper prop validation and documentation
3. IF code complexity increases THEN the system SHALL break it into smaller, focused modules
4. WHEN functions are implemented THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive unit tests
5. IF dependencies are added THEN the system SHALL keep them up-to-date and secure
6. WHEN code is reviewed THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent coding standards
7. IF performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide profiling and optimization tools

### Requirement 7: Real-time Data & Offline Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time updates and continue working when offline, so that I always have access to current information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tank levels change THEN the system SHALL update the UI in real-time via WebSocket connections
2. WHEN the network is available THEN the system SHALL sync offline changes automatically
3. IF the connection is lost THEN the system SHALL continue working with cached data
4. WHEN data conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution mechanisms
5. IF real-time updates fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to polling with exponential backoff
6. WHEN the application goes offline THEN the system SHALL show appropriate status indicators
7. IF sync fails THEN the system SHALL queue changes for later synchronization

### Requirement 8: Mobile Experience Enhancement

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want a native app-like experience with touch-optimized interactions, so that I can use the application effectively on my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is used on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide touch-optimized interactions
2. WHEN users swipe or pinch THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate gestures
3. IF the screen is small THEN the system SHALL adapt layouts for optimal mobile viewing
4. WHEN forms are filled on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide mobile-friendly input methods

6. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL provide core functionality without network access
7. IF performance is slow THEN the system SHALL implement mobile-specific optimizations

### Requirement 9: Testing & Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that I can ensure the application works reliably across all scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is deployed THEN the system SHALL have at least 80% test coverage
2. WHEN user interactions occur THEN the system SHALL be tested with automated end-to-end tests
3. IF performance regressions occur THEN the system SHALL detect them with performance tests
