# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines comprehensive responsive design requirements for the PetroManager petroleum distribution SaaS platform. The goal is to ensure the entire application provides an optimal user experience across all device types - mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers. The application currently has some responsive components and mobile optimization features, but requires systematic enhancement to achieve full responsiveness across all pages, components, and user interactions.

The current codebase includes mobile detection hooks, responsive preview components, and some mobile-optimized components, but lacks consistent responsive implementation across all features. This specification addresses the need for comprehensive responsive design that maintains functionality, usability, and performance across all screen sizes.
