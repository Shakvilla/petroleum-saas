# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan converts the responsive design requirements into a series of coding tasks that will systematically transform the PetroManager application into a fully responsive system. Based on analysis of the current codebase, the plan addresses critical gaps in dashboard components, navigation systems, data tables, and form components.

The plan follows a test-driven approach, prioritizing core infrastructure first, then building responsive components incrementally, and finally integrating everything together. Each task builds upon previous work and focuses on specific coding activities that can be executed by a development agent.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ **Already Responsive:**
- Basic mobile detection hooks (`useMobile`, `useIsMobile`)
- Mobile-optimized table components with card views
- Some chart components with `ResponsiveContainer`
- Settings preview components for theme testing
- Basic mobile layout wrapper

### ❌ **Critical Gaps Identified:**
- **Dashboard Components**: `TenantOptimizedDashboard`, `ModernDashboardOverview` lack mobile optimization
- **Navigation System**: `DashboardLayout` has no mobile navigation implementation
- **Data Tables**: `UsersTable` uses standard table layout without mobile card view
- **Forms/Modals**: `AccessibleModal` has fixed sizes, no mobile behavior
- **Charts**: Fixed height containers don't adapt to mobile screens
