# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical gaps in the current multi-tenant architecture of the petroleum SaaS application. The current implementation has basic tenant routing and state management but lacks proper tenant isolation, security boundaries, and enterprise-grade multi-tenant patterns. This enhancement will implement a comprehensive multi-tenant architecture that ensures data isolation, security, and scalability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Tenant Context Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a centralized tenant context management system, so that all components can access tenant information consistently and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and resolve the current tenant from subdomain, domain, or path parameters
2. WHEN a tenant context is established THEN the system SHALL provide a React context provider that makes tenant information available to all child components
3. WHEN tenant information changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update all components that depend on tenant context
4. IF no valid tenant is found THEN the system SHALL redirect to a tenant selection page or show an appropriate error
5. WHEN the tenant context is accessed THEN the system SHALL include tenant ID, settings, branding, features, and permissions

### Requirement 2: Tenant-Aware API Client

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an API client that automatically scopes all requests to the current tenant, so that data isolation is enforced at the API level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL automatically include the current tenant ID in request headers
2. WHEN creating, reading, updating, or deleting data THEN the system SHALL scope all operations to the current tenant
3. IF a request attempts to access data from a different tenant THEN the system SHALL reject the request with an appropriate error
4. WHEN the tenant changes THEN the system SHALL invalidate all cached data from the previous tenant
5. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL validate that all returned data belongs to the current tenant

### Requirement 3: Tenant-Scoped State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want state management that automatically isolates data by tenant, so that no cross-tenant data leakage can occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing application state THEN the system SHALL include tenant ID as part of the state key
2. WHEN switching tenants THEN the system SHALL clear all tenant-specific state and reload data for the new tenant
3. WHEN persisting state to localStorage THEN the system SHALL use tenant-scoped keys to prevent data mixing
4. IF state is accessed without a valid tenant context THEN the system SHALL throw an error
5. WHEN using React Query THEN the system SHALL include tenant ID in all query keys

### Requirement 4: Permission-Based Feature Access

**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want to control which features are available to my organization, so that I can manage costs and functionality based on my subscription plan.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component renders THEN the system SHALL check if the current tenant has access to the required features
2. IF a feature is not available to the tenant THEN the system SHALL hide or disable the feature with appropriate messaging
3. WHEN feature flags change THEN the system SHALL immediately update the UI to reflect the new permissions
4. IF a user attempts to access a restricted feature THEN the system SHALL show an upgrade prompt or access denied message
5. WHEN checking permissions THEN the system SHALL consider both tenant-level and user-level permissions

### Requirement 5: Tenant-Specific Theming and Branding

**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want to customize the appearance of the application with my company's branding, so that the application feels like our own product.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL apply the current tenant's branding including colors, logos, and fonts
2. WHEN tenant branding changes THEN the system SHALL immediately update the visual appearance without requiring a page refresh
3. IF no custom branding is configured THEN the system SHALL use default branding
4. WHEN generating PDFs or exports THEN the system SHALL include the tenant's branding
5. WHEN displaying tenant-specific content THEN the system SHALL use the tenant's preferred language and date formats

### Requirement 6: Cross-Tenant Data Leak Prevention

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to ensure that data from one tenant never appears in another tenant's interface, so that data privacy and security are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying data lists THEN the system SHALL filter out any data that doesn't belong to the current tenant
2. WHEN performing searches THEN the system SHALL only search within the current tenant's data
3. IF cross-tenant data is detected THEN the system SHALL log a security event and block the operation
4. WHEN caching data THEN the system SHALL use tenant-specific cache keys
5. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL validate that all exported data belongs to the current tenant

### Requirement 7: Tenant-Aware Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want error messages and handling that are appropriate for my organization's context, so that I can understand and resolve issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL include tenant context in error logging
2. WHEN displaying error messages THEN the system SHALL use the tenant's preferred language and terminology
3. IF a tenant-specific error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide tenant-appropriate resolution steps
4. WHEN logging errors THEN the system SHALL include tenant ID for proper error tracking and resolution
5. IF a cross-tenant error is detected THEN the system SHALL immediately log a security incident

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization for Multi-Tenancy

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to perform well regardless of the number of tenants, so that the system can scale to support many organizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading tenant-specific data THEN the system SHALL use efficient caching strategies that don't interfere with other tenants
2. WHEN switching between tenants THEN the system SHALL load data in under 2 seconds
3. IF a tenant has large amounts of data THEN the system SHALL implement pagination and lazy loading
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track metrics per tenant to identify performance issues
5. WHEN optimizing the application THEN the system SHALL ensure that optimizations don't compromise tenant isolation
