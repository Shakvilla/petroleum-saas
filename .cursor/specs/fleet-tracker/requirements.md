# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Fleet Tracker component is a reusable, modern mapping solution that provides real-time vehicle tracking capabilities throughout the petroleum SaaS application. This component will display live vehicle locations, movement patterns, and provide comprehensive fleet management features with beautiful, industry-standard map visualizations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Mapping Functionality

**User Story:** As a fleet manager, I want to view real-time vehicle locations on an interactive map, so that I can monitor fleet operations and respond to issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component loads THEN the system SHALL display an interactive map with current vehicle positions
2. WHEN a vehicle moves THEN the system SHALL update its position on the map in real-time
3. WHEN the user zooms or pans the map THEN the system SHALL maintain vehicle visibility and performance
4. WHEN multiple vehicles are present THEN the system SHALL display all vehicles simultaneously without performance degradation
5. IF a vehicle is offline THEN the system SHALL display the last known position with appropriate visual indicators

### Requirement 2: Vehicle Information Display

**User Story:** As a fleet manager, I want to see detailed information about each vehicle, so that I can make informed decisions about fleet operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a vehicle marker THEN the system SHALL display a popup with vehicle details
2. WHEN displaying vehicle information THEN the system SHALL show vehicle ID, driver name, current status, speed, and last update time
3. WHEN a vehicle is in motion THEN the system SHALL display current speed and direction of movement
4. WHEN a vehicle is stationary THEN the system SHALL show duration of current stop
5. IF vehicle data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error states

### Requirement 3: Real-time Updates and Performance

**User Story:** As a fleet manager, I want to receive real-time updates about vehicle movements, so that I can respond to changing conditions immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vehicle positions change THEN the system SHALL update the map within 5 seconds
2. WHEN the component is active THEN the system SHALL maintain WebSocket connections for real-time data
3. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle reconnection and data synchronization
4. WHEN multiple users view the same fleet THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent data across all instances
5. IF real-time updates fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to periodic polling with user notification

### Requirement 4: Route and History Tracking

**User Story:** As a fleet manager, I want to view vehicle routes and travel history, so that I can analyze fleet performance and optimize operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a vehicle THEN the system SHALL display its current route if available
2. WHEN displaying routes THEN the system SHALL show planned vs actual paths with visual differentiation
3. WHEN a user requests historical data THEN the system SHALL display past routes with time-based filtering
4. WHEN showing route history THEN the system SHALL provide playback controls for time-based visualization
5. IF route data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL display available segments with appropriate indicators

### Requirement 5: Geofencing and Alerts

**User Story:** As a fleet manager, I want to set up geofences and receive alerts, so that I can monitor vehicle compliance and respond to boundary violations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a vehicle enters a restricted area THEN the system SHALL trigger an alert notification
2. WHEN a vehicle exits an allowed zone THEN the system SHALL display appropriate warnings
3. WHEN geofences are configured THEN the system SHALL display them visually on the map
4. WHEN alerts are triggered THEN the system SHALL provide configurable notification methods
5. IF geofence data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue normal operation without geofencing features

### Requirement 6: Responsive Design and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want to access fleet tracking functionality, so that I can monitor operations from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component is viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide touch-optimized controls
2. WHEN the component is viewed on tablets THEN the system SHALL adapt layout for medium-sized screens
3. WHEN the component is viewed on desktop THEN the system SHALL provide full feature set with keyboard navigation
4. WHEN users have accessibility needs THEN the system SHALL support screen readers and keyboard navigation
5. IF the screen size is too small THEN the system SHALL provide essential functionality with appropriate UI adaptations

### Requirement 7: Integration and Reusability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily integrate the fleet tracker into different parts of the application, so that I can provide consistent tracking functionality across the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating the component THEN the system SHALL accept configuration props for customization
2. WHEN the component is used in different contexts THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent behavior and styling
3. WHEN multiple instances are used THEN the system SHALL share data efficiently without conflicts
4. WHEN the component is embedded THEN the system SHALL respect parent container dimensions and styling
5. IF integration requirements change THEN the system SHALL provide backward compatibility for existing implementations

### Requirement 8: Data Management and Caching

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want efficient data handling, so that the application performs well even with large fleets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vehicle data is received THEN the system SHALL cache recent positions for offline viewing
2. WHEN historical data is requested THEN the system SHALL implement pagination and lazy loading
3. WHEN the component unmounts THEN the system SHALL clean up resources and connections
4. WHEN data volume is high THEN the system SHALL implement data throttling to maintain performance
5. IF data storage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate cleanup strategies
